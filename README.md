# DrinkLoudr
A Processing volume controller turned into a party game - increase volume or tempo for each drink you've drunk.

Includes three sketches, one for a volume-based increaser, one for a tempo-based increaser, and one for just a simple volume
control that follows the same principles. Good for parties and for controlling volume.
